Advanced HTML text 2

In this task we want you to add some semantics to the provided HTML as follows:

-Turn the second paragraph into a block-level quote, and semantically indicate that the quote is taken from Accessibility.

-Semantically mark up "HTML" and "CSS" as acronyms, providing expansions as tooltips.

-Semantically associate machine-readable dates with the dates in the text.

-Use subscript and superscript to provide correct semantics for the chemical formulae and dates, and make them display correctly.
